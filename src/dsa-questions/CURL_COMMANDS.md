## üí° Tips

1. **Use PowerShell Variables** (Windows):
```powershell
$TOKEN = "your_token"
$BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000"

# Then use in commands
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$BASE_URL/dsa-progress/statistics" -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $TOKEN"}
```

2. **Pretty Print JSON** (with jq):
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/dsa-progress/statistics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

3. **Save Response to File**:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/dsa-progress/statistics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -o statistics.json
```

4. **Test Multiple Questions**:
```bash
for question in two-sum reverse-linked-list valid-parentheses; do
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/dsa-questions/$question"
done
```
